// Push notifications: asking, registering this phone with the Worker, and

//
// The token is the phone's native one — APNs on an iPhone, FCM on Android —
// from getDevicePushTokenAsync, not an Expo push token: the Worker sends to
// Apple and Google itself (worker/src/apns.js, worker/src/fcm.js), as it
// always has for the iPhone app.
//
// Remote notifications need a development build; Expo Go on Android has none
// since SDK 53, and a simulator has no token. Every step here gives up quietly
// rather than stand between a person and their messages.
